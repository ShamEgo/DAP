Any new upgrade steel work, e.g. channels etc.  will accelerate the deterioration of the already heavily corroded sections.However, if RNE continue with the strategy to upgrade the mast further, then RNE Engineers structural analysis certification would need to take into account the current condition of the mast.It is not viable for Telstra to refurbish repair the existing mast so one way or another, it is likely that the structure will need to be replaced in the next year or two.Given that Towers Infrastructure Management can only replace structures like for like life cycle, it is likely that the mast replacement will be a joint funded exercise",2014-06-15,3B - PM4 - 5 Years,"IP: 50026842 (CARNARVON AIRPORT, ID14204, WA, FY21 LCR - MAST REPLACEMENT, SP30088588 ) Scope LCR / Refer to the full scope of works document: EDMS persistent link http://objects.in.telstra.com.au/documents/CCI-9261",3B - PM4 - 5 Years,FXD,Legacy Status: PM4,SP30077262 WO0000,1/08/2018 12:00:00 AM,2022-01-25,14204_1,STR_1,michael.c.armour@team.telstra.com,,,CARNARVON AIRPORT CMTS,14204,AMPLITEL,40000,,,Jan 26 2022 11:13AM,,,Patrick.J.Kennedy@team.telstra.com,,,,C (Medium),D,MAST GUYED,42.0,2022-03-16,-24.889282887,113.671751038,NOT PAINTED,5.0,1.2764152435256595
